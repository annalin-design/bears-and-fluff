# About us

“Your body is not a temple, it’s an amusement park. Enjoy the ride.” These were the words of the late Anthony Bourdain, a renowned food writer and chef. Words that two bears couldn’t agree with more. Of course, it’s important to maintain the park and keep it pristine but why do all that work when you don’t take the ride?

Welcome to Bears n’ Fluff, where the motto is healthy fluff is fed with delicious food. Our mission to find the tastiest recipes, experience new foods and most importantly enjoy the ride while maintaining just the right amount of fluff. I mean who has ever heard of an un-fluffy bear, am I right? Here, you’ll find the recipes and restaurants we managed to forage. Our ultimate goal? Well, it’s to spread and spark a discussion of good eats and a love of food. We test every recipe and make our own tweaks before adding them on, so you can rest assured that it is absolutely one hundred percent bear approved!

You may be wondering, but what do bears eat? Well the ones without palettes would eat things like grass, roots, berries and insects. Even though we’re open to anything, we would much prefer to forage for saucy pizza with a crispy crust, dumplings ready to burst of marinated meats and juices, and all things delicious for our diets. From Chinese to French to American, you’ll find us munching on something pretty tasty. Started in 2020, Bears n’ Fluff aims to document our favourite dishes and hotspots to eat (and partly so we can remember the recipes).

Feel free to take a look at around and if you think there’s any food we should try, please [let us know](mailto:bearsnfluff@gmail.com). You learn a lot about someone when you share a meal together so what are we waiting for? It’s time to eat! And always remember, stay fluffy my friends!
