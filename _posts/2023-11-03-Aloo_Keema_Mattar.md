## Instructions
1. Saute the onion and garlic on medium-high heat until soft and begins to brown. It there are some bits stuck to the pan, can add water to loosen them.
2. Stir in the ground beef and peppers. Cook until beef is browned and crumbly.
3. Reduce the heat to low-medium and stir in the coriander, salt, cumin, cayenne and turmeric.
4. Add potatoes and tomatoes. Cover and simmer until potatoes are soft. Sprinkle the garam masala afterwards and incorporate in.
5. Serve on rice.

## Notes
- Can adjust the amount of cayenne used depending on desired spice level.
- Makes a great filling for fried goods such as samosas and spring rolls
