## Instructions
1. Mix all ingredients (except pork) together into a marinade. Set aside 2 tbsp of marinade before stirring the pork in (to be used later for cooked pork).
2. Cut the pork butt into about 1-inch thick strips if necessary.
3. Marinate the pork with the marinade using a zip lock bag. Let sit in fridge for 24 hours.
4. Place pork on cooking rack and brush the marinade from the bag on to the pork. Keep any excess in a bowl and set aside. Cook in oven for about 30 minutes at 450ºF.
5. Take out the pork and baste with some of the marinade from the bag that was set aside. Flip the pork and continue to baste. Cook for about another 20 minutes in the oven.
6. Baste with the 2 tablespoons of non-contaminated marinade. Let the pork rest, then slice and serve.

## Notes
- If you have any remaining marinade from the bag that was used to marinate the pork, can place into a small sauce pot and gently reduce down. Bring to a simmer for at least for about 5 minutes; it will make a nice sauce for the char siu
- The char siu is great served on a bed of white rice with some pickled vegetables or sauteed bok choy.
