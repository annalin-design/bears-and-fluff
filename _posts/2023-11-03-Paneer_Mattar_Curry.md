## Instructions
1. Saute the onion and garlic on medium heat until soft and begins to brown. It there are some bits stuck to the pan, can add water to loosen them.
2. Stir the crushed tomatoes and bring it up to a gentle simmer.
3. Add the yogurt and incorporate until it is well mixed in.
4. Reduce the heat to low-medium and allow the mixture to continue simmering. Add the coriander, cumin, garam masala and turmeric. If the curry is too sour, add salt to balance out the flavour. Then add the sugar.
5. Put in the paneer first to warm through, then the peas to do the same.
6. Serve on rice.

## Notes
- Depending on how good the tomatoes are and the greek yogurt it can come out quite tangy/sour. Balance this out with more salt and sugar if needed.
- Can add protein if desired. Just cook the protein during the phase inbetween cooking the onions and adding the crushed tomatoes.
