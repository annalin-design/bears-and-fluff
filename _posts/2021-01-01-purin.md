## Instructions

2. Boil milk in a pot. Can use the same pot as the caramel.
3. In a separate bowl, mix eggs and sugar. Pour in hot milk slowly to prevent cooking the eggs.
4. Strain the custard mixture. Pour mixture into the 4 ramekins with caramel on the bottom.
5. Place the ramekins in a pan, and fill the pan with hot water.
6. Bake for 300Â°F for 35-45 minutes. Center should still jiggle a little.
7. Cool and refrigerate. Serve cold!
