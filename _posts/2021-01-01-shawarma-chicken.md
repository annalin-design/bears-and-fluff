## Instructions
1. Combine oil, honey, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, oregano, turmeric, garlic and lemon juice into a Ziploc bag.
2. This is an optional step, but if you would like to make this into skewers cut the thighs into 1-inch chunks.
3. Ensure the air is pressed out and the bag is sealed. Give the bag a good mix so that the contents inside is fully mixed.
4. Refrigerate for 1-12 hours.
5. After marinating, take the bag and put the thighs on a baking sheet lined with parchament paper or on a grill rack with the baking sheet underneath. If planning to make skewers, place cubes on metal or soaked wooden skewers, aiming for 5 pieces per skewer.
6. Cook at 425ºF for about 30 minutes total. About halfway through at 20 minutes take the chicken and flip them; then cook for the another 10-15 minutes.
