## Instructions
1. Chop the brick of tofu into three rectangles about an inch thick. 
2. Cover the tofu with paper towel to help drain out excess moisture for about 45-60 minutes.
3. Combine soy sauce, mirin, gochujang, sesame oil, garlic powder and honey in order to make the tofu marinade. Set aside
4. Once drained, chop tofu into small 1 inch cubes.
5. Mix the tofu and marinade together. Combine well and let marinade for 30-40 minutes at room temperature. 
6. Pan fry the tofu at medium-high heat, adding in as much of the marinade as you can to the pan in order to allow it to braise and thicken. Tofu is ready when all the marinade becomes a thick sauce and should not be runny.

## Notes
- Best served on a bed of hot rice in order for that sauce to be absorbed. Can also serve with a side of vegetables and kimchi.
