thumb: assets/images/default.jpg
ingredients:
- 150 grams Fresh Arugula
- 1.25 cups Almonds (toasted)
- 2/3 cups Olive Oil
- 2 tbsp Lemon Juice
- 1 tsp Kosher Salt
- 1/3 cup Parmesean (grated)
- 2 cloves Garlic (smashed)

## Instructions
1. Toast the almonds. 
2. Add the arugula and oil to a blender. Blend into a fine mixture.
3. Add the almonds and garlic to the mixture and continue blending. Again, a fine mixture.
4. Add in the lemon juice, salt and parmesean. Continue to blend until a fine mixture or desired consistency.
5. Serve over pasta of choice.

## Notes
- The arugula and oil are usually combined first in order to get a base going which will then be easier to blend everything. 
- If the pasta is warm, the pesto will adhere to it nicely. A few spoonfuls will be enough. 
- The pesto can also be refrigerated and will last at least a couple weeks in the fridge. Exact testing is still required.
