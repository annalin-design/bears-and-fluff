## Instructions
1. Mix the flour, water, yeast and salt together. 
2. Ensure that its mixed to the point where you can see as little dry flour left on the bowl as possible. Looking for a semi-sticky dough consistency.
3. Let it stand in the bowl for about 4-5 hours to allow dough to rise. Cover the bowl to prevent dough from drying out. 
4. Shape the dough into baguettes. Should produce about 2. Score the top of each.
5. On a baking sheet, allow the dough to rise again for about 1-2 hours. Cover with a towel to prevent the bread from drying out.
6. Preheat oven to 450ºF. Once at the temperature, place the bread into the oven on the top rack. Add a container of water on the bottom rack. Bake for about 10 minutes, then take the container of water out.
7. Allow the bread to cook for another 15 minutes until a golden crust forms on the outside.

## Notes
- Best to eat these when they are fresh out.
- Can be used more like an ingredient and incorporated into other dishes.
- It is very important to make sure the water is lukewarm or it may kill the yeast.
- When the bread is sliced, you can lightly toast it in the pan to get a crispier texture.
- The water in the oven may not be needed, but does make the bread exterior crispier as well.
