## Instructions
1. Add water to a medium or large pot and bring the water up to a boil. Keep heat on high.
2. Dissolve the dashi powder into the water as it starts to simmer. Stir until well combined.
3. Chop the green onions into small bite sized pieces in necessary and dice the tofu into small cubes. Set aside.
4. As water continues to heat up and simmers; add the tofu and green onions (as well as other optional ingredients).
5. Once boiling, reduce heat down to medium and leave at a simmer. Add the miso paste. 
6. Continue simmering until desired flavour is reached.



## Notes
- If you decide to add the optional garnishes of enokis or nori, ensure to add them into the soup for a few minutes to cook and let it get warm before serving. 
- Ensure to stir the soup occasionally and right before serving so the miso doesn't sit. Stirring well help keep it incorporated throughout the soup.
- Can dilute with more water if too salty or reduce further to strengthen the umami.
