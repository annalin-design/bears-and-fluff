## Instructions
1. Pre-heat the oven to 325°F.
2. Combine the dry ingredients together and set aside. This will include the flour, baking soda and salt.
3. Beat the butter, both white granulated and brown sugars and the vanilla extract until fluffy.
4. Add the eggs to the butter mixture and beat for about 15 seconds more.
5. Combine the wet ingredients with the dry mixture in the first step. After it is well incorporated, add the chocolate chips into the mix.
6. Another optional step would be to refrigerate for about 30-60 minutes.
7. Bake for 325°F for 8-15 minutes.

## Notes
- Reducing the sugar and butter to this recipe will make the cookies have a more cakey texture and consistency
- Granulated sugar: spread and crispy
- Brown Sugar: soft and chewy
