## Instructions
1. Cut the tofu into small rectangular discs and place into a shallow dish. 
2. Combine the soy sauce, dashi, ground ginger and yuzu. 
3. Add the marinade onto the tofu and try to spoon it over so the tofu is completely covered. 
4. Chill in the fridge until desired.
5. Take the tofu out and plate on a separate plate. Serve cold. Add garnishes if desired.

## Notes
- The dish is meant to be served cold or at most room temperature. Would not advise to serve it any temperature higher than that. 
- This dish relies heavely on the tofu. Ensure that you keep it chilled and try to get a tofu that is as fresh as possible. The sauce will add the flavour but a lot of the satisfaction is through texture and temperature. 
- Garnishes are nice to add variety but is not necessary.
