## Instructions
1. Using boiling water, blanch the tomatoes for roughly 1 minute in order to remove the skin. Make a cross shape at the end of each tomato to assist in this process. 
2. After boiling, shock the tomatos in cold water until comfortable to touch and then peel the tomatoes. Discard the skin.
3. Quarter each tomato and remove the seeds and juice. Then cut into bite-sized dice. Set both aside in separate bowls.
4. Mince the garlic and add it along with oil, salt and optional vinegar to the bowl of diced tomatoes. Mix well.
5. Slice the baguette and toast on the pan until crisp. 
6. Serve the tomatoes onto the baguette slices and garnish with arugula and/or basil if desired. 

## Notes
- Blanching the tomatoes for just the right amount of time is very important. Keeping them submerged under the boiling water will make the skin easier to peel while not cooking the flesh.
- This dish will have a relatively strong garlic flavour. If you aren't a fan, add less as the raw garlic has quite a bite.
