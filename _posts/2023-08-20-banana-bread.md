## Ingredients
- 1.5 cup All Purpose Flour
- 2 tsp Baking Soda
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1/4 cup Unsalted Butter Room Temp.
- 2/3 cup Dark Brown Sugar
- 1/3 cup Sour Cream or Greek Yogurt
- 2 Eggs
- 4 Bananas
- Chocolate
- Walnuts

## Instructions
1. Mix flour, baking soda and salt. Set Aside.
2. In another bowl whisk butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add in eggs one at a time, beat until smooth. Hand mixer recommended, or it will be an arm workout.
3. Add in dry flour mixture, mix until just well combined. Fold in mashed bananas, chocolate and walnuts.
4. Line parchment paper in loaf pan and pour the batter inside. Top with chocolate/walnuts if desired.
5. Bake at 350°F for 55-60 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean in the center. If the outside is turning brown but inside is undercooked, continue baking at a lower temperature (~300°F)

## Notes
Can add some lemon zest & fresh lemon juice for extra aroma/flavour
